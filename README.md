Styling for Web Forms
=====================
The purpose of this repo is to provide easy access to styling blocks for the web forms modules. Add the styles you need to the css override block within the page. 

Additional classes can be added to the inputs by clicking the '+' beside the form until you get to the individual inputs. Click on one and there is a section for parameters that should have a <cssClass> tag already there. You can add your custom class there to get this to do what you want.
